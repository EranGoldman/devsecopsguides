# Secrets Management
{: .no_toc }


Secrets management refers to the process of securely storing, managing, and accessing sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and other credentials. Secrets are a critical component of modern applications, and their secure management is essential to ensure the security and integrity of the application.

Secrets management typically involves the use of specialized tools and technologies that provide a secure and centralized location for storing and managing secrets. These tools often use strong encryption and access control mechanisms to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.

Some of the key features of secrets management tools include:

1. Secure storage: Secrets management tools provide a secure location for storing sensitive information, typically using strong encryption and access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access the information.

2. Access control: Secrets management tools allow administrators to define access control policies and roles that govern who can access specific secrets and what actions they can perform.

3. Auditing and monitoring: Secrets management tools provide auditing and monitoring capabilities that allow administrators to track who accessed specific secrets and when, providing an audit trail for compliance and security purposes.

4. Integration with other tools: Secrets management tools can be integrated with other DevOps tools, such as build servers, deployment tools, and orchestration frameworks, to provide seamless access to secrets during the application lifecycle.
