## Threat Modeling




Threat modeling is a process that helps identify and prioritize potential security threats to a system or application. The goal of threat modeling is to identify security risks early in the development process and proactively mitigate them, rather than waiting for vulnerabilities to be discovered after deployment.

One popular method for conducting threat modeling is called STRIDE, which stands for Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of service, and Elevation of privilege. These are the six types of security threats that can affect a system, and by considering each of them in turn, a threat model can help identify potential vulnerabilities and attacks.

The STRIDE methodology is often used in combination with a diagram designer tool, such as Microsoft's Threat Modeling Tool or the open-source OWASP Threat Dragon. These tools allow you to create a visual representation of the system or application you are analyzing, and to map out potential threats and attack vectors.



<span class="d-inline-block p-2 mr-1 v-align-middle bg-green-000"></span>Explains the six types of security threats in the STRIDE methodology:


| STRIDE Threat    | Description   | 
|:---------------|:---------------------|
| `Spoofing` | Impersonating a user, device, or system in order to gain unauthorized access or perform malicious actions. Examples include phishing attacks or using a fake SSL certificate to intercept data.	 | 
| `Tampering` | Modifying data or code in transit or at rest, in order to introduce errors, gain unauthorized access, or perform other malicious actions. Examples include modifying the source code of an application or altering data in a database.	 | 
| `Repudiation` | Denying or disavowing actions or events, in order to evade accountability or responsibility. Examples include denying that an action was taken, or that data was accessed.	 | 
| `Information Disclosure` | Revealing confidential or sensitive information to unauthorized parties, whether intentionally or accidentally. Examples include disclosing passwords or user data, or exposing private keys.	 | 
| `Denial of Service` | Disrupting or degrading the availability or functionality of a system or application, through network attacks, resource exhaustion, or other means. Examples include Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks or flooding a server with requests.	 | 
| `Elevation of Privilege` | Gaining additional access or privileges beyond those that were initially granted, in order to perform unauthorized actions or escalate an attack. Examples include exploiting a software vulnerability to gain administrative access or using a social engineering technique to obtain sensitive information.	 | 


### Implementation

Step 1: Define the Scope

Identify the application or system within the DevSecOps pipeline that you want to perform threat modeling for. For example, let's consider a microservices-based application deployed using containerization and managed by Kubernetes.

Step 2: Gather Information

Gather information about the application's architecture, design, and deployment. This includes understanding the components, their interactions, data flows, and external dependencies.

Step 3: Identify Threats and Assets

Identify the critical assets and sensitive data involved in the application. Consider both internal and external threats that could compromise the security of these assets. For example:
Unauthorized access to customer data stored in a database
Injection attacks on APIs or containers
Misconfiguration of Kubernetes resources leading to unauthorized access or privilege escalation

Step 4: Assess Vulnerabilities and Risks

Evaluate the architecture and design to identify potential vulnerabilities and risks associated with the identified threats. Consider the security implications at each stage of the DevSecOps pipeline, including development, testing, deployment, and operations. For example:
Insecure container images containing known vulnerabilities
Lack of proper access controls on Kubernetes resources
Weak or outdated authentication mechanisms

Step 5: Prioritize and Mitigate Risks

Prioritize the risks based on their potential impact and likelihood of occurrence. Develop mitigation strategies and recommendations to address each identified risk. Consider integrating security controls and best practices into the DevSecOps pipeline. For example:
Implementing automated vulnerability scanning and patch management for container images
Applying secure configuration practices for Kubernetes resources
Enforcing strong authentication and access controls at all stages of the pipeline

Step 6: Continuously Monitor and Improve

Incorporate threat modeling as an iterative process within the DevSecOps lifecycle. Regularly review and update the threat model as the application evolves or new risks emerge. Continuously monitor the system for potential threats and vulnerabilities.

Real-case Example:

In a DevSecOps context, consider a scenario where a development team is building a cloud-native application using microservices architecture and deploying it on a container platform. The threat modeling process could involve identifying risks such as:

* Insecure container images with vulnerabilities
* Weak authentication and authorization mechanisms
* Inadequate logging and monitoring for containerized applications
* Misconfiguration of cloud resources and access controls
* Insecure communication between microservices
* Injection attacks on API endpoints

Based on the identified risks, mitigation strategies could include:

* Implementing automated vulnerability scanning and image hardening for containers
* Applying strong authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as OAuth or JWT tokens
* Incorporating centralized logging and monitoring solutions for containerized applications
* Establishing proper cloud resource management and access control policies
* Encrypting communication channels between microservices
* Implementing input validation and security controls to prevent injection attacks

## Threat detection 


| Abnormal network traffic    | Potential threats    | 
|:---------------|:---------------------|
| `Port/host scan` | The port or host scan behaviors mean one of the hosts may have been infected by a malware program, and the malware program is looking for vulnerabilities, other services, or hosts on the network.	 | 
| `A high number of outbound DNS requests from the same host` | This is a symptom of Command and Control (C&C) malware, establishing communication between the infected host and the C&C server using the DNS protocol. 	 | 
| `A high number of outbound HTTP requests from the same host` | This is a symptom of C&C, establishing communication between the infected host and the C&C server using the HTTP protocol.	 | 
| `Periodical outbound traffic with samesized requests or during the same period of time every day ` | This is a symptom of C&C malware, establishing communication between the infected host and the C&C server.	 | 
| `Outbound traffic to an external web or DNS listed as a known threat by threat intelligence feeds` | The user may be tricked through social engineering to connect to an external known threat web or the C&C connection is successfully established. 	 | 

To visualize the network threat status, there are two recommended open source tools: Malcom and Maltrail (Malicious Traffic detection system). Malcom can present a host communication relationship diagram. It helps us to understand whether there are any internal hosts connected to an external suspicious C&C server or known bad sites
https://github.com/tomchop/malcom#what-is-malcom





## Indicators of compromises 

An analysis of hosts for suspicious behaviors also poses a significant challenge due to the availability of logs. For example, dynamic runtime information may not be logged in files and the original process used to drop a suspicious file may not be recorded. Therefore, it is always recommended to install a host IDS/IPS such as OSSEC (Open Source HIDS SEcurity) or host antivirus software as the first line of defense against malware. Once the host IDS/IPS or antivirus software is in place, threat intelligence and big data analysis are supplementary, helping us to understand the overall host's security posture and any known Indicators of Compromises (IoCs) in existing host environments.

Based on the level of severity, the following are key behaviors that may indicate a compromised host:


 
### External source client IP
The source of IP address analysis can help to identify the following: 
A known bad IP or TOR exit node 
Abnormal geolocation changes 
Concurrent connections from different geolocations 
The MaxMind GeoIP2 database can be used to translate the IP address to a geolocation: 
https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/#Downloads

### Client fingerprint (OS, browser, user agent, devices, and so on)
The client fingerprint can be used to identify whether there are any unusual client or non-browser connections. The open source ClientJS is a pure JavaScript that can be used to collect client fingerprint information. The JA3 provided by Salesforce uses SSL/TLS connection profiling to identify malicious clients.
ClientJS: https://clientjs.org/
JA3: https://github.com/salesforce/ja3

### Web site reputation
When there is an outbound connection to an external website, we may check the threat reputation of that target website. This can be done by means of the web application firewall, or web gateway security solutions
https://www.virustotal.com/

### Random Domain Name by Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs)
The domain name of the C&C server can be generated by DGAs. The key characteristics of the DGA domain are high entropy, high consonant count, and long length of a domain name. Based on these indicators, we may analyze whether the domain name is generated by DGAs and could be a potential C&C server. 
DGA Detector: https://github.com/exp0se/dga_detector/
In addition, in order to reduce false positives, we may also use Alexa's top one million sites as a website whitelist. Refer to https://s3.amazonaws.com/alexa-static/top-1m.csv.zip. 

### Suspicious file downloads
Cuckoo sandbox suspicious file analysis: 
`https://cuckoosandbox.org/`

### DNS query 
In the case of DNS query analysis, the following are the key indicators of compromises:
DNS query to unauthorized DNS servers. 
Unmatched DNS replies can be an indicator of DNS spoofing.
Clients connect to multiple DNS servers. 
A long DNS query, such as one in excess of 150 characters, which is an indicator of DNS tunneling. 
A domain name with high entropy. This is an indicator of DNS tunneling or a C&C server.
